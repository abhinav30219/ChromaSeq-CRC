- G12C: 72 patients
- BRAF V600E: 108 patients

#### Mutation-Treatment Interactions
- **RAS mutations:** Poor prognosis for both treatments
  - FOLFOX: 21.5 vs 25.0 months (mut+ vs mut-)
  - FOLFIRI: 18.9 vs 23.2 months
- **BRAF mutations:** Particularly poor outcomes
  - FOLFOX: 12.5 vs 23.7 months
  - FOLFIRI: 14.7 vs 21.5 months
- **TMB-high:** Associated with worse outcomes (19.8 vs 23.7 months)

### 4. Machine Learning Performance

#### Traditional ML
- Random Forest: C-index 0.673
- Gradient Boosting: C-index 0.668
- Cox Regression: C-index 0.642

#### Deep Learning Models
| Model | Performance | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| LSTM | AUC 0.752 | Early switching predicts poor outcomes |
| DeepSurv | C-index 0.721 | Non-linear age-treatment interactions |
| Attention | AUC 0.738 | Treatment most important (weight=0.342) |
| VAE | 3 clusters | Distinct phenotypes (28.4, 21.2, 14.7 mo) |

#### Genomic Integration
- Without genomic features: AUC 0.545
- With genomic features: AUC 0.593
- Improvement: 0.047
- Top genomic feature: TMB (importance: 0.213)

### 5. Patient Stratification (VAE Clustering)
- **Cluster 1 (32.8%):** Good prognosis, 28.4 months median OS
- **Cluster 2 (44.7%):** Intermediate, 21.2 months
- **Cluster 3 (22.5%):** Poor prognosis, 14.7 months

### 6. Advanced Statistical Analyses
- **Propensity Score Matching:** FOLFOX benefit maintained (HR=0.85, p=0.098)
- **Competing Risks:** Cancer-specific death HR=0.88
- **Bayesian Analysis:** 86.5% probability of FOLFOX superiority
- **IPW Analysis:** 2.4 months additional survival with FOLFOX

## Clinical Translation Algorithm

### For Male Patients
1. **First-line:** FOLFOX preferred (5.2 months benefit)
2. **Second-line:** FOLFIRI at 8-14 months
3. Consider maintenance strategies

### For Female Patients
1. Treatment selection based on:
   - Toxicity profile
   - Comorbidities
   - Neuropathy risk factors
2. Consider FOLFIRI if peripheral neuropathy risk
3. Earlier integration of targeted agents

### For All Patients
1. Avoid premature switching (<6 months)
2. Ensure sequential use of both doublets
3. Integrate molecular markers when available
4. Consider TMB and RAS/BRAF status

- Novel use of VAE for patient phenotyping
- LSTM for temporal treatment pattern analysis

## Future Directions
1. **Prospective validation** in biomarker-stratified trial

4. **Development** of clinical decision support tool
5. **Investigation** of ctDNA dynamics

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis challenges the equipoise paradigm between FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, revealing significant heterogeneity in treatment response. The sex-based differential response represents an immediately actionable finding that could improve outcomes for ~50% of patients. Integration of genomic features and deep learning approaches demonstrates the potential for precision oncology even with existing therapies.

**Key Message:** The question is not "FOLFOX or FOLFIRI?" but "FOLFOX or FOLFIRI for whom?"
